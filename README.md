# dennis

On a quiet and sunny summer day when no one was around, when I was only 11 or 12 years old, I started writing code for the first time in my life, in the C programming language. And now here we are, almost 15 years have passed since those days when I started writing this project. From the moment I first started writing until today, my love for C has only grown. I was lucky enough to start earning my living by writing code, because I think I am among the minority of people who love what they do. Therefore, I may have worked with dozens of different technologies in dozens of different projects, it may not be right for me to say this as a professional, but still, none of them could replace C. Here's this project, Dennis, a C compiler. A love letter I sent to my past. I hope it will be useful to someone. Enjoy.
